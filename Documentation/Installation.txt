======================================= DAQLab project installation notes (4 Feb 2017) =======================================

The following instructions have been tested on a 64-bit Windows 10 Pro machine.
==============================================================================================================================


1. NI-DAQmx
-------------------------------

- To perform measurements using National Instruments compatible hardware, if not present, install National Instruments NI-DAQmx 16.0.1 (or newer) from: 			
	http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/10181

2. NI CVI
------------------------------- 

- Install CVI 2015 SP1 or later. Please note that the current version of DAQLab was tested with CVI 2015 SP1 and that other versions may have problems 
loading the project files, which is the case for CVI 2015 SP1. If NI-DAQmx is not present and use of National Instruments hardware is not intended, ignore the 
LabWindows/CVI Message that appears on opening the DAQLab project:
	<< Unable to open file
   	   "C:\...\Shared\CVI\toolslib\custctrl\daqmxioctrl.fp"
   	   (File not found)                                      >> 

3. HDF5 data storage
-------------------------------

- To be able to store measurement data in the HDF5 format, install HDF5-1.10.0-patch1 or a newer version (if still compatible) which can be found at:
	https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5110.html

- In the CVI 2015 SP1 project window, go to 'Options->Environment->(Advanced) Include paths' and press Switch Lists (or F6) to edit include paths specific to 
the DAQLab project. Add the HDF5 'include' folder, e.g. 'c:\HDF_Group\HDF5\1.10.0\include' and delete from the list any outdated HDF5 path if present.

- Check if in the CVI 2015 SP1 project window, in the 'Data Storage' folder hdf5.lib exists. If not, right click on the 'Data Storage' folder, select 
'Add existing file' and add 'hdf5.lib' from the HDF5 lib folder, 'e.g. c:\HDF_Group\HDF5\1.10.0\lib'. If it exists, check if it points to the correct 
installation path and if not, right click on it and select 'Replace file in project' and update the path.

- Make the following changes to the installed HDF5 files:
	a) In include\H5Gpublic.h and include\H5public.h change '#include <sys\types>' to '#include <types>'
	b) In include\H5pubconf.h:
		- set '#define H5_HAVE_VISUAL_STUDIO' to 0
		- set 'H5_HAVE_SYS_STAT_H' to 0
		- set 'H5_HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H' to 0
        c) To get proper dll exports add to include\H5api_adpt.h to the end of the file just before #endif /* H5API_ADPT_H */: 
           '#define H5_DLLVAR __declspec(dllimport)' 

4. NI Vision Development Module
-------------------------------

NI Vision Development Module 2016 has been used to display images acquired by the laser scanning module and to provide basic means to interact with the image, 
e.g. to select regions of interest. As NI Vision needs a separate license, if already present, it may be readily used by the laser scanning module. 
If purchasing NI Vision Development Module is not feasible, another way images can be displayed is to use native CVI controls, albeit this feature is not 
yet fully implemented. To switch between the display engines, in 'Laser Scanning\LaserScanning.c' replace '#include "ImageDisplayNIVision.h"' with 
'#include "ImageDisplayCVI.h"' and include 'Display\ImageDisplayCVI.c' in the build by right cliking on it in the project view and selecting 
'Include File in Build'.

5. Building the project
-------------------------------

In the CVI 2015 SP1 workspace select 'Build->Build'. At this point there may be hardware-specific DLLs that were not found which belong to various modules 
in the project. To remove these dependecies from the project, find the missing .lib file (if any) in the workspace folders as well as the modules .c file
using the library and exclude both from the build by right-clicking these files and selecting 'Exclude File from Build'. If all went well, the Build 
process will create 'DAQLab.exe' which can be launched from the project view by pressing the green launch triangle.
